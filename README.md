# Culture

Welcome to the Serverless Culture Handbook! This document is our guiding star when it comes to sharing company culture, team expectations, and all the processes that make us clip along at a (hopefully) quick pace.

Like everything in a fast moving startup, this is a living document. At Serverless we pride ourselves on every team member having the ability to impact all aspects of the company, including this handbook. That means that as things get out of date or become inaccurate you have the power to make the necessary changes through a pull request. 

If you are brand spanking new and this is your first introduction to Serverless please use your fresh set of eyes to ask questions, point out things that don't make sense, or catch some typos. We want to this to be an intuitive stream lined document and as time marches on there is a strong possibility that it will start to resemble something closer to Frankestein than a flawlessly designed Apple product. It's all of our responsiblities to keep it clean and concise.
