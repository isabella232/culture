# How to complete a performance review

Performance reviews are a lot of work for both managers and team members. It can be daunting to reflect on our achievements and shortcomings and then have a detailed conversation about them. 

The benefits of performance reviews greatly outweigh any of the discomfort. In 2016 Gallup reported that “the opportunity to learn and grow is one of the top three factors in retaining millennials” ([Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/193274/millennials-jobs-development-opportunities.aspx) 2016). Team member performance and job satisfaction increases when they understand how their work contributes to larger company goals and they are coached on where to focus on improvement as well as opportunities for growth. 

The following document is a general guide to help managers and team members navigate performance reviews in the most efficient and effective way possible. As we complete each round of performance reviews this document will be updated to reflect best practices.

## Performance review timeline

**Month leading up to performance reviews**

Casey sends out performance assessment surveys to each team member. Currently Google Forms.

Each team member completes a performance assessment:

1. For themselves
2. For anybody they work with regularly**
3. For their manager

** If you are a manager this includes each person you manage

Team members will complete all their performance assessments by the announced deadline in order to give their managers enough time to compile their performance reviews.

**1-2 weeks before the performance reviews**

Managers compile the performance assessments into a single document.

Casey schedules each person's performance review with their manager.

## Performance review agenda
1. Check-in about how the team member is feeling both personally and professionally.
2. Team member shares their assessment of their performance.
3. Manager shares consolidated team feedback report.
4. Manager guides the discussion of similarities and differences in the performance appraisal.
5. Manager receives feedback and suggestions from team member.
6. Manager and team member work together to set performance expectations for the following quarter, finalize OKRs, and identify developmental opportunities for next appraisal period.
